## Usage 

The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

The project must generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)

## Credits
